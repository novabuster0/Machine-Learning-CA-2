## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict if a bank customer will leave. By analyzing demographic, financial, and behavioral data, the model helps banks keep customers and reduce losses.

### 🧩 Key Features

- Conducts data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analyzes factors impacting customer churn through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Trains and compares various machine learning models.
- Evaluates model effectiveness using standard metrics.
- Identifies which model best predicts customer churn.

## ⚙️ Methodology / Approach

### 1. Data Preparation

- The application imports a dataset about bank customers. This includes important details like Credit Score, Age, Balance, and Account Activity.
- It removes irrelevant identifiers like CustomerId and Surname to focus on useful data.
- Categorical variables are transformed into a format the model can understand.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Missing values are filled or removed to ensure complete data.
- Outliers are detected and managed to improve overall model accuracy.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizations are created to identify trends in the data.
- Key factors influencing customer retention are analyzed.

### 4. Model Training

- Several machine learning classification models are trained.
- Each model's performance is compared to determine the best one.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- The most effective model for predicting customer churn is identified based on this evaluation.
